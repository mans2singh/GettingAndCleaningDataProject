#### Background
The HAR data set was collected from 30 volunteers while performing 6 activities wearing a Samsung Galaxy II smartphone as mentioned on ![UCI HAR Data Set site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#### UCI HAR Data Set
The data used for this project is available from ![
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

##### Data Source:
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - UniversitÃƒ  degli Studi di Genova, Genoa I-16145, Italy. 

For the project the data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

#### Analysis Project
The analysis project involves the following steps: 
* Merging the test and train data measurements and associating variable names with the observations, and combining the measurements with the subject and activity id.
* Extracting only variables with standard deviation and mean in the name,  
* Provide descriptive names for the variable, and 
* Finally to find the average of each variable by each subject and each activity.  

#### Data files
The following data files, located in the unzipped data directory, were used for the analysis:
* features.txt for variable names
* activity.txt for activity id to activity name mapping
* Test data 
	* test/X_test.txt containing measurements
	* test/y_test.txt containing the activity id for each measurement
	* test/subject_test.txt containing the subject id for each measurement
* Train data
	* train/X_train.txt containing measurements
	* train/y_train.txt containing the activity id for each measurement
	* train/subject_train.txt containing the subject id for each measurement

The measurements have been normalized and bounded between -1 and 1.

#### Selected Features
The features selected for the analysis are those that include Mean or mean and std in it's name.  A comprehensive list of the features is available in the **features.txt** file in the unzipped data directory.

#### Descriptive feature names
To create descriptive names the variable or features transformed as follows:
* variable name starting with **t** were replaced by **time** to indicate time domain measurment
* variable name starting with **f** was relaced by **freq** to indicating frequency domain transformation)
* variable names with **mean** or **std** were replaced by **Mean** and **Std**
* All commas, parenthesis and hyphens are remove removed.

##### Variable name format decision
The variable names were chosen to be camel-case so that they are easy to ready.  The shortened parts of names of were left as such so that the context of the variables generated is not lost in translation and the names don't get too long. (Eg: in the first row below - tBodyAcc-mean()-X, is transformed to timeBodyAccMeanX) 

#### Examples of two variable name and their transformation:
    
    |--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
	| Original Name                        | Transformed Name                          |
	|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
	| tBodyAcc-mean()-X                    | timeBodyAccMeanX                          |
	| angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)     | angleTimeBodyAccJerkMeanGravityMean       |
	|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
	

#### Selected features list

Detailed description of the features and the naming convention is available in the **features_info.txt** file in the top level directory of the unzipped UCI data.
From the feature_info.txt file, the following features were selected based on occurrence of the **mean**, **Mean**, or **std** in the name.  The rationale for selecting all the matching fields is that each represents a different measurement for each subject and activity and these need to be averaged per subject per activity.

Following is the list of selected features:

#### Final feature names
The final variable names in the computed statistics data set includes the  
* subject id, 
* activity id, 
* activity name, and 
* 86 average of measurements corresponding to the origin variables mentioned above after transforming the variable names.  The values for these variables are the **mean** of the values for that metric grouped by each subject and activity.  
* Design decision  
	* To avoid extra long variable names, did not add extra suffix to each measured variables' average
	* Keep the activity_id reference in tidy data so that it can be used to join to other tables in future


Following is the list of variables in the final tidy set table:

1 subject_id
